## Securing your devices

Read the [How to survive guide][1] in the Congress Wiki. There are
many excellent tips in there.

### Backups

Make fresh backups of ALL the devices you bring to CCCongress. Test
that you can actually restore data from those backups!

### BIOS/EFI Password

Make sure you do have set a BIOS or EFI Password to prevent booting
from a live CD to attack your system.

### Full disk encryption

Activate full disk encryption with pre-boot authentication. (Mac:
Activate FileVault.)

### Backups

You did make fresh backups of all your devices, did you?


### VPN tunnel

- OpenVPN
- L2TP/IPSec
- SSH
- [SSHuttle][9]
- iodine (DNS tunnel for those pesky for-pay captive portal WiFi networks)
- Tor/Vidalia

Also have those tunnels configured on ALL the devices you intend to
use, and have it tested. That includes your Laptops, phones, tablets,
servers, fridge, etc.

### Phones

It is not recommended to connect your smartphone to the congress wifi,
if you still can't resist, here are a few things to consider:

- disable all synchronization services, (plaintext auth)
- disable all auto-discovery services
- make sure there are no known exploits for your device
- Turn off push notifications
- use a VPN tunnel if possible
- use a Firewall and only allow the (few) services you trust.
  - [DroidWall][20] for Android (root required)
- If you don't have a VPN tunnel available, you can use
  [OnionBrowser][7] to surf via tor (which may be it's own kind of
  risk)

**If you are unsure** that there might still be some services running
  and transmitting plaintext data, **do not connect**.
